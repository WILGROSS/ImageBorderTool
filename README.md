# Image Border Tool
***A simple app to add white borders to the top/bottom/sides of your images***

I wanted to simplify my workflow of uploading my photos to instagram.
<br />Instead of tediously uploading them to google drive, saving them to my phone, opening them one by one in an app to add the borders and then saving them again one by one, I can now quickly add the correct borders to my photos in just a few clicks.

### How to use
- Select your image(s) in the file explorer
- drag and drop them directly onto ImageBorderTool.exe or right click on them > open with... > select ImageBorderTool
- Done! The tool creates a folder in the same location as the images and places the new bordered images there! One fullsize and one for websites (600px*600px)
